# Keypoint Factory

Keypoint Factory is a library for training and evaluating local feature extraction models. It is inspired and created from [CVG's Glue Factory](https://github.com/cvg/glue-factory). The goal for Keypoint Factory is to allow users to:
- reproduce various keypoint detectors and extractors.
- train models on multiple datasets
- evaluate feature extractors uniformly across standard benchmarks.

## To-do
- [ ] Finalize and clean evaluation code
- [ ] Add more benchmarks such as ScanNet, IMC2020, etc.
- [ ] Add training code for SuperPoint Open
